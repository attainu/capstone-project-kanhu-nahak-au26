	CAPSTONE PROJECT
E-commerce Website

Name: Subir Ghosh and Kanhu Nahak
Batch: H.J. Bhabha

Objectives of Project:
1. Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. Option to add, edit, view and delete all the items in our store.
3. Option to add items or remove items from the cart for the user.
4. Display the total bill of the cart and update it as soon as the cart is updated by the user.
5. Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy items.
6. Option to pay using Stripe Checkout and thus creating a new order and emptying the cart after payment is successful.
7. Option to view all your past orders along with the bill amount for each.
So, these are the basic features we would be having in our application. Now, let’s get familiar with the tech stack we are going to use for building this application.
Frontend — In the frontend side, we would be using React as the frontend library. We would use Redux for state management. We would use React Bootstrap library for basic designing of the interface.
Backend — For the backend side, we would be using the Express library on top of Nodejs. We would use MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store our data as documents in JSON format. We would use mongoose to connect to our MongoDB database.
We would create REST APIs with Express and use these endpoints in the React frontend to interact with our backend part.
